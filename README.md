Official Ruby wrapper for Dwolla's API

## Version

- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)

## Installation
The easiest way to install the dwolla-ruby gem for now is to use bundler and add the following line to your Gemfile:

The recommended way to install dwolla-ruby is through RubyGems:

## Examples / Quickstart

To use the examples in the /examples folder, first edit the _keys.rb file and add your Dwolla API application's key, and secret, along with your account's [OAuth token](https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token), and PIN.

This repo includes various usage examples, including:

* Authenticating with OAuth [oauth.rb]
* Fetching user information [users.rb]
* Grabbing a user's contacts [contacts.rb]

* Transacting money (includes sending) [transactions.rb]
* Getting a user's balance [balance.rb]

## Changelog
